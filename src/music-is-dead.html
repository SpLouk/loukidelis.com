      <h1>Music is dead; long live music</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">November 21, 2022</p>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>It’s all folk music now</em></p>
      <p class="first-paragraph">
        The importance of musical movements and the innovation of new genres has
        been declining for some time now. I know that people have been saying
        this forever. I also realize that, at 26, I’m the prime age to join the
        “music is dead” camp; the bands I loved as a teenager are old now. But,
        in my mind at least, it’s not that I’m disappointed by the new styles of
        music coming out; I’m not even claiming that new music is particularly
        bad. I’m really asking:
        <em>where is the new music?</em> Like, not that there aren’t a billion
        songs being made every second, but where are the new styles? Where are
        the sounds that will define the early 2020s in popular culture? Listen
        to the first 30 seconds of this song:
      </p>

        Someone who is familiar with popular music of the last 50 years or so
        will probably be able to place this song in a timeline of musical
        movements with a decent amount of accuracy – i.e. be able to guess that
        the song was released in the 1980s. Will we be able to identify 2020s
        music the same way?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s my layman’s theory of modern music: movements in popular music
        have been mostly driven by technological and social change. Invention of
        instruments like the piano, the saxophone, and later the electric guitar
        and synthesizer pushed music forward and allowed the creation of new
        genres. The invention of these instruments created completely new sonic
        frontiers; musical landscapes which literally could not have been
        explored before. Before the synth was created –
        <em>less than 100 years ago –</em>
        synthy sounds had never existed for the entirety of human history. Of
        course, we moderns are used to the miracles our age.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 20th century fostered a perfect storm of both technological and
        social change (perhaps not a coincidence?). New instruments like the
        electric guitar mixed with new social attitudes: sexual freedom,
        individualist self-expression, fast living, good times. We got jazz and
        rock and roll out of this. Then we got a whole bunch of other genres.
        New technology and artistic experimentation continued to spur new genres
        in an exponential explosion. The rate of change and diversification
        accelerated: it was much faster in the 1970s than in the 1930s. There
        were simply more people in bands, and trying to make it in the music
        industry. Probably the simplest way to understand what happened is that
        suddenly there was a massive incentive (through the ability to record
        and sell music) and social motivation to innovate new forms of music.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music genres became attached to (and spawned) social scenes. These
        social scenes were an extremely important part of teenagers’ identities
        in the late 20th C. In the 1950s, youth culture itself was a novelty;
        the idea that teenagers represented their own identity and demographic,
        with their own preferences for music and movies was new. The relatively
        unified early youth culture of Elvis, The Beatles and Buddy Holly
        fragmented into a million subcultures: punk, heavy metal, disco, grunge,
        hip-hop, all the subcultures that hip-hop eventually broke into,
        whatever the Talking Heads were, etc. People used to dress like the
        bands they listened to, form their politics, and hang out with other
        people based on music taste! That’s mostly over now. Most people my age
        and younger listen to “a bit of everything”. Music discovery happens
        through Spotify playlists and Tik Tok, where specific artists have
        become commoditized, accessed through playlists or videos seeking a
        certain sonic mood. None of this means that music is any less enjoyable
        to listen to, of course. For those of us who love music, it’s more
        accessible than ever. It’s just not socially or politically important.
        Again, this is a long-term trend, something that I’m sure began even
        before Limewire and Napster.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to be bold here and claim that music innovation has basically run
        it’s course, at least for now. Let me explain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve described how music innovation has generally happened along two
        axes: technological and social innovation. Barring some kind of miracle,
        I think I can confidently say that we’ve reached the end of
        technological innovation for sound creation. Modern synthesizers can
        create any tone or sound at high fidelity. Sure, new organic instruments
        could be created, but I think it would be hard to create something that
        is both A. Radically different than what already exists and B. Sounds
        pleasant. Artists have been experimenting with sound for a century now
        (actually since the beginning of time, but in the context of the modern
        music industry). Bryan Wilson was using bike horns and coke cans in Pet
        Sounds in the 1960s. The Beatles famously experimented with the sitar.
        I’m happy to be proven wrong, but I just don’t think that there are
        whole <em>new sounds</em> to be discovered; micro-innovations sure, but
        we’re never getting something like the electric guitar revolution again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then that leaves social change. I think it’s hard sometimes to
        understand just how different the past was from today. Before teen
        culture came into existence in the post-WW2 years in the USA, music was
        not an identity for young people. The massive social change in the 50s
        and 60s ushered in the modern era of popular music, and the
        establishment of music as a foundation of identity for young people. The
        post-WW2 shift of our social priorities towards individualism, sexual
        freedom, and the pursuit of self-actualization is reflected in our
        popular music like a mirror held up to our collective consciousness. If
        the rock n’ roll revolution could be seen as a break from what came
        before it, a rebellion, then the decades that have followed have been
        closer to iterations on the same ideas, even as genres devour one
        another and fashions change like the wind. Until our culture experiences
        another “break”, a social paradigm shift, I don’t think we will see
        radical new ideas in musical styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this is all just my crackpot speculating. To be honest I never
        thought too much about this stuff before. I don’t worry about where my
        music comes from, I just <em>consume</em>. But when the source dries up
        I start to go looking around for a cause. What are kids listening to
        these days? When I go out now, the music is a hodgepodge of popular
        music from the last 20 years. This is great for my ego, but it’s not
        exactly expanding my horizons. Commercially,
        <a
          href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/old-music-killing-new-music/621339/"
          >old music now outsells new music</a
        >, and for myself I can’t name any important developments or new styles
        of music from the last couple of years. The most recent I can think of
        is the late-2010s mumble rap &amp; trap wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there’s the pop charts. Take a look at this list of the
        <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/hot-100-songs/"
          >top songs of 2021</a

        />
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve added the musical styles that I can detect as major influences on
        each song. Six out of eight of the most popular songs of 2021 had major
        influences from historic music genres!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, ok, I understand that the pop charts aren’t exactly the best place
        to find the cutting edge of music. The pop charts are not for music
        lovers; they’re for dentist’s offices and college move-in days. There
        are still many, many people who love music. What are they listening to?
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been listening to a brand called Drugdealer lately. I had it
        recommended to me by a friend who loves music, then another friend who
        loves music. I finally gave them a chance, and I like them a lot. I’ve
        been listening to their new album on repeat. But here’s the thing: their
        music wouldn’t be out of place in the 1970s. In fact, it would be
        impossible for almost anyone to listen to this band and not think
        something like “This band has a 70s sound”. Now, Drugdealer writes
        original songs, but sonically they fit squarely in a musical movement
        that came and went a long time ago. Is this a bad thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        Before the industrial revolution, before capitalism kick-started an
        insatiable incentive system for innovating new sounds in music (and
        recording those sounds, and the creation of “intellectual property”),
        music looked a lot different. You might say that where music creation
        looked most similar to today was in the upper-class of Western society.
        There, classical music was composed by writers who were well known and
        paid for their work. Music was written in notation, allowing it to
        persist relatively unchanged (though until recording was invented it
        would still have to be played live), and so music composition followed
        movements; composers were influenced by the composers who came before
        them. They studied their work, improved on it, or rejected it and
        created something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the vast majority of people, in the West and elsewhere, this was not
        the case. Music was passed down in living rooms, bars, at funerals and
        in battlefields. Music, what we now call folk music, belonged to the
        culture, not the individual, not a specific generation. Sounds were
        passed on and persisted for a long time. They changed too, through
        evolution. Each musician leaves a fingerprint on what they play. But
        innovation, differentiation played second fiddle to familiarity. What
        was appealing to a people was more important than what was new.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve gotten used to a state of affairs that is in actuality an
        aberration in the larger context of music history. The past 100 or so
        years have seen an exponential growth in music recording, innovation,
        technology and development. We’ve come to accept this as completely
        normal, but maybe what we’re seeing now is the twilight of a completely
        exceptional era of human history. What’s old is new. We are going back
        to the days of folk music. Of course, much has changed. The mountain of
        music recorded by our ancestors still exists. It’s likely that people
        will still listen to the Beatles (and maybe even Blink 182) in 100, 200
        years. Our great-great grandchildren will have a favourite album of the
        1970’s, just like myself and people my age. New music will be recorded,
        but popular taste will put less emphasis on what is new and instead
        refocus on simply <em>what sounds good</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this a bad thing? I don’t know. The human art form called music
        blossomed in an unexpected and beautiful way in the last century. The
        music this produced – the recordings and the musical styles – is
        precious to me, personally, and billions of other people also. To
        imagine a future where this time period is scene as a kind of
        “renaissance” era that came and went in a few generations is sad to me
        in some way. Still, I welcome the “folkification” of music. To enjoy
        music simply for the joy it creates, rather than being concerned about
        listening to the <em>right genres</em> and the right artists is freeing.
        When all the hype is over, when the glamour and lifestyle is stripped
        away, we’re left with what we really came for anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, the process I’m talking about is nothing new. It has quietly
        happened to every music scene whose moment in the spotlight is over.
        Mark Knopfler understood this. Swing was going through it in the 70’s
        when he wrote these lyrics:
      </p>
      <div class="spacer"></div>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces<br />
          Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down<br />
          Competition in other places<br />
          Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound<br />
          …<br />
          And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene<br />
          He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright<br />
          He can play the Honky Tonk like anything<br />
          Savin' it up, for Friday night<br />
