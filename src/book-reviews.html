            A book on the ways that our "convential wisdom" on economics don't
            track to a wealthy society. Makes good points in favour of government
            spending that convinced my small-gov peabrain. Not as inspiring of a
            writer as Henry George though. Most of Galbraith's urged adjustments
            to our collective feelings about taxation and gov't spending are still
            undone. As relevant today as when it was written. <br /><br />I do
            think there are some compelling counterpoints to Galbraith's criticism
            of private goods production. He often uses car manufacture as
            examples. He points out that the R&amp;D put into new car models is
            goaled around what can be advertised to consumers to make them ditch
            their old models. I'm no fan of car companies so I'll give him that
            one. But, the computer and software revolution feels to me like a case
            where private companies have substantially improved the lives of the
            average person. The fundamental ground work for the internet, and
            computers, was laid by military research of course, but the private
            market used that kernel (heh) of research and infrastructure and
            fundamentally changed the world. Now, some people may argue it hasn't
            been for the better. We can agree to disagree.<br /><br />Anyway in
            general I agree that we could do well to spend more money on public
            infrastructure. Now, exactly what infrastructure that should be is the
            tricky part. He makes a few to many favourable mentions of urban
            renewal projects and highway building for my liking... <br /><br />

          <p>
            Out of Africa by Isaak Denison is a memoir; a collection of stories
            from the life of a woman, and her time living in Africa Between 1913
            and the early thirties. Denison is an aristocrat – a rich white
            settler in what is now Kenya. She owns a coffee farm in the Ngong
            hills, where the native people of that region serve her in her house
            and work in her fields. <br /><br />The circumstances that allowed
            this woman to occupy a small piece of Africa are understood by the
            modern reader to be unjust. The British colonial empire has claimed
            for its own land which was already inhabited and used by people since
            the beginning of time. This woman does not herself work the land to
            which she lays claim; she uses the profits from her farm to hire
            servants and labourers. Her lover, a man named Denys Finch-Hatton,
            born in England and educated at Eton, seems to view Africa as his
            rich-boy playground; he inhabits it only so that he might shoot and
            kill all of it’s largest animals for trophies, yet manages to feel
            contempt and condescension towards the natives of the land.<br /><br />Yet,
            out of this clusterfuck of colonialism and racism emerges a book that
            still finds itself read today, one hundred years later. Why? Our
            narrator, despite her position as gentlewoman strangler of African
            sovereignty, ends up being someone who is able to write about this
            place, and its people, with a level but empathetic voice. She sees the
            people of her farm as they are, and admires them all, Somali, Indian,
            Kikuyu and European alike. Can this woman be blamed for the
            colonization of Africa? I don’t think so, but I still cringe when I
            read some passages. It is her interest in the people of Africa,
            something that the other Europeans of the colony lack, which redeems
            this book. This book is a memoir; a memoir of the people of the Ngong
            hills.<br /><br />Out of Africa meanders this way and that, with
            little point or explanation for itself. It is simply the account of
            one woman on a coffee farm in Kenya. The same way that this book takes
            its time leisurely, so did I, requiring almost a year to read it. I
            would suggest anyone else to read it in the same way. Pick it up when
            you feel interested, and then put it down again for a while. In this
            way the lack of a cohesive point becomes a benefit, and you will read
            this as a series of vignettes which may seem similar to how you
            remember your own life: a series of events, specific vivid moments and
            long blurry stretches, windows peeking into time that hide much more
            than they show. At the end of her book, when the house she has lived
            in has been emptied of its furniture and echoes with her footsteps,
            Isaak Denison is there, alone, sitting on a box of books with the moon
            spilling in through the windows, with only her memories left.

            As far as I know, this is an accurate history of the Mennonites of St.
            Jacobs and Elmira. The author is not an academic, and during some
            parts of the book I could sense her investment and involvement in the
            community she writes about.

            Scaramouche might as well be called "The Forrest Gump of the French
            Revolution". Andre-Louis Moreau, also known as Scaramouche, quips his
            way from profession to profession, leaving no deed left undone –
            despite his own continual insistence that he is not a man of action.
            This prodigious prodigal son finds himself swept up in the events of
            the French Revolution after setting out to settle a personal score
            with his charming nemesis, the Marquis de la Tour d’Azyr; adventure
            ensues. This is a relatively straightforward story brilliantly told –
            the perfect adventure novel, with swashbuckling, one-liners, romance,
            and rivalry. The pacing is good, and the book is never uninteresting,
            though the back-half unfolds into a true page-turner.<br /><br />P.S.
            Every time Andre-Louis wields a pistol, he lets his adversary know
            that he is about to “burn his brains” and I think that is the best
            action-movie-ism ever.<br /><br /><img

            A book about the complexity, beauty and wonder of the human
            experience. A book about people.<br /><br />Only, are these people
            that complex? They read like poorly sketched caricatures. The
            simple, sentimental dad who wants his son to see him. The brooding,
            sentimental son who wants to prove himself. The bitter, tightly
            wound, sentimental bank executive, the sentimental bank robber, the
            sentimental rabbit-man who crashes apartment viewings. Why is this
            book so goddam sentimental? It's like every ten pages the book is
            asking me whether I'm crying yet, and when I say no it's like ok how
            about now, now that I've told you just how sad all of these people
            are, and how deeply they care. We're all just really the same,
            right? We just want to be
            <span style="font-style: italic">loved</span>, right? Are you crying
            now?<br /><br />I know this book really wants to be about the
            messiness of life. It wants to be that so bad. So why is everything
            in it so much the opposite? This book trying to seem chaotic is like
            that kid at your high school who didn't drink but still tried to
            show everyone how crazy they could be at parties. We know you're
            forcing it dude. Everything in this novel down to the last box of
            Christmas lights is exactly where the author left it. The cellphone
            is placed just-so, so that when it vibrates the gun falls off the
            table and fires. Luckily there's also stage blood on the floor there
            for some goddam reason so now when our policemen arrive on the scene
            they'll have a real time trying to figure out why the bank robber
            shot herself. I'm not nitpicking because this is a microcosm of the
            goddam entire book. Every character's plot arc is wrapped up so
            neatly that there's no room left for me to feel anything about any
            of it.<br /><br />Why do the people in this book do things that no
            real people ever do? This is a book about people right? When I read
            a book about people I like for it be a little bit like how I
            experience people in real life. Do real people:<br />- decide to
            commit suicide because the bank took their home, and then leave a
            note for the CEO of the bank saying "It's not your fault"?<br />- Go
            to apartment showings for 10 years to look at a bridge from
            different angles because <i>trauma</i>?<br />- Hire a rabbit-man to
            ruin an apartment showing to drive down the price of the apartment
            to win a bid on the apartment to keep their husband's ego protected
            to keep their marriage intact?<br /><br />Idk, maybe in Sweden?

          <p>
            In Le Guin's afterword to "The Ones", she clarifies a point that is
            ambiguous in the original text – she writes that freeing the child
            in the broom closet would doom every citizen of Omelas to "suffer as
            hopelessly as the child does now". My interpretation of the bargain
            as I read it was that freeing the child would merely cause Omelas to
            backslide from a Utopia to a mediocre city surrounded by plains,
            like Winnipeg.<br />This clarification makes the dilemma posed by
            this book harder to map to any useful moral question that faces us
            in the real world. If freeing the child dooms everyone to a
            miserable existence, including presumably the freed child, there is
            no utilitarian case for doing so. Is this a parable against
            utilitarianism?<br /><br />The real life analogues for the child,
            the global poor, oppressed minorities, farmed animals, could they be
            saved without dooming us all? We could stop eating animals today and
            be healthier and richer. What if we had to stop benefiting from the
            plentiful, cheap labour of the global underclass? We would be
            poorer; would we be wretched? Le Guin herself doesn't think so; she
            wrote The Dispossessed shortly after publishing this story, an
            earnest exploration of anarchism and communalism, in which the
            materially poor society is much better off than the rich one.<br /><br />In
            "The Ones", Le Guin seems to posit that the very moral virtue,
            scientific knowledge, and great art of this society follow from a
            child's torture. I cannot think of a real-world problem that puts us
            in this bind. If there is none, then why write this story? Why spend
            any time thinking about it? I admire Le Guin enough to hope there is
            a point here I am missing, but I don't see it. <br /><br />
