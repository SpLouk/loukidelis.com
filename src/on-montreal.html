      <h1>Montreal is an Affordable Urbanist's Paradise</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">September 19, 2022</p>
      <p class="first-paragraph">
        Montreal, Quebec is the second largest city in Canada after Toronto, and
        only about 5 hours away by car. I had (aside from a brief visit for a
        music festival as a teenager) never been there until last week. I am
        much more familiar with Toronto, having grown up nearby in Hamilton. I
        now live in Waterloo, Ontario, also close to Toronto – about 100km to
        the West. Toronto, Hamilton and Waterloo actually share a lot of
        similarities in their built forms (at different scales) that are
        recognizable across a lot of North America. They are dominated by
        detached homes, often set back from the road by lawns. Multi-family
        housing is generally confined to the downtown, and mainly comes in the
        form of high-rise towers. Toronto is a large city, but I am always
        amazed at how <em>suburban</em> the metropolis is. Sure, the downtown
        core is stocked with very, <em>very</em> tall skyscrapers. But venture
        just a little bit outwards and you’re more likely to find single-family
        detached homes than anything else. Take a look at this Google streetview
        photo:
      </p>

        <p class="image-caption">
          A street directly beside the Runnymede subway station in Toronto. Some
          of these homes are duplexes; many of them are not.

      </div>
      <p>
        This street is a two minute’s walk to a subway station on the Bloor
        street line. The entire neighbourhood surrounding this station (and many
        other Toronto subway stations) is essentially suburban in form. I don’t
        want to waste too much time pointing out the flaws in Toronto’s urban
        design, but I think this kind of underuse of infrastructure – which is
        frozen in time by our zoning code – emphasizes how the fetish for
        suburban homes has a cultural stranglehold on us in English Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, on to Montreal. My partner and I recently spent a week in Montreal
        for no particular reason except to visit some friends and see the city.
        She was working remotely, but I had the week off and plenty of time to
        explore. I chose cycling as my preferred way to get around, which was
        nice because it allowed me to cover a larger geographical area rather
        than being restricted to where I could walk from the neighbourhood we
        were staying in. I was really amazed, biking around, at the frequency at
        which my “missing middle” alarm bells rang.

        So much of Montreal looks like the middle of this infographic. Lots of
        it looks like the right end of the density gradient, and some of it
        looks like the left end. Here are some photos I took while biking
        around:

        These photos are mostly from the more downtown areas of Montreal, but I
        ventured further out into the suburbs as well and found lots of similar
        development, albeit with more car infrastructure. Wider roads gave the
        neighbourhoods less of an intimate, urban feel, but it was still quite
        <em>different</em> compared to suburbs in the Greater Toronto Area.

        As I explored, I became convinced that “missing middle” housing is the
        default in Montreal. This is true whether the neighbourhood is old or
        new, suburban or urban. Sure, I also saw single family detached homes:

        But in general these were the exception, not the rule. I wanted to see
        whether my impression matched reality. Thanks to
        <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/">https://censusmapper.ca</a> I was
        able to look at the predominant housing forms in Montreal and Toronto
        using Canadian census data. The following images show Montreal and
        Toronto from the same scale, coloured by the predominant housing type in
        each census area as of the 2016 census. Red areas feature predominantly
        single family detached homes (the legend mistakenly includes duplexes),
        the blue areas are predominantly duplexes, rowhouses, and lowrise
        apartments, and the green areas are predominantly highrises.

        You can see that Toronto is more of a mixed bag than Montreal. The
        older, historic part of the city features lots of blue. The downtown is
        visible along lake Ontario as solid green, and the newer, more far flung
        parts of the city are a splotchy patchwork of red and green, with little
        missing middle. Montreal at the same scale is almost solid blue, with
        isolated patches of red and a few green areas. You can explore the maps
        yourself,
        <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/718#12/45.5278/-73.6319">here</a>
        (Montreal) and
        <a href="https://censusmapper.ca/maps/718#12/43.7202/-79.4224">here</a>
        (Toronto). I also mapped both cities according to population density per
        square kilometre according to the 2021 Canadian census:

        The results are a little less obvious here. Both cities have large areas
        of low population density. I will admit that I did not venture off
        Montreal island into the surrounding communities. Still, the central
        part of Montreal has a larger area of purple hues (higher-density)
        compared to central Toronto.

        One thing that always comes up in conversations with friends about
        Montreal is its affordability. Rent for a similar apartment in Montreal
        compared to Toronto might be cheaper by $1000/month. Even Waterloo, the
        midsized university town, population 200,000, where I live, has more
        expensive rent than Canada’s second largest city. When I talked to
        Montrealers about this, they were quick to point out that it is not as
        cheap to live there as it once was, but admitted that it is still cheap
        compared to other Canadian cities. When asked why they thought Montreal
        has a better housing market, they told me that because proficiency in
        French is a requirement for finding work in Montreal, and that barrier
        to the economy limits population growth and keeps people out. While I
        don’t want to doubt local knowledge, I think that this only tells part
        of the story. Montreal’s population <em>has</em> been growing, if not
        quite as fast as Toronto’s.

        These growth charts look fairly similar. I believe that the way Montreal
        builds housing is the main cause of its relative affordability. But
        affordability aside, letting more people live in urban areas where they
        can be close to where they work, close to grocery stores, etc. just
        seems <em>good</em>. Doesn’t this:

        Don’t get me wrong, I think highrise condos and single family detached
        homes have their place. Lots of people want a large home with a lawn.
        But more than anything people want an affordable place to live. It would
        be nice if detached homes and condo towers weren’t essentially the only
        two housing options in most of North America. I imagine that if people
        were given the option to live in the kinds of communities that I found
        in Montreal, many – not all, of course! – would.

        I didn’t come to Montreal as a blank slate. I had already formed
        opinions on the merits of mixed-use, walkable neighbourhoods, density,
        etc before my visit. But seeing this pattern of development in the real
        world, experiencing how nice it is, how functional and how affordable,
        was vindicating. Above all, it showed me that beautiful, lively
        neighbourhoods don’t have to be for rich people only. I think that
        people tend to associate walkable, treed neighbourhoods with high rents.
        In North America they usually are. What I saw in Montreal, whether this
        was <em>caused</em> by the development pattern or not, is that all kinds
        of people can and do live in these sorts of neighbourhoods. I would love
        for that to be true for other cities too.
