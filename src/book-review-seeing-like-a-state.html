      <h1>Book Review: Seeing Like a State</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">September 16, 2022</p>
      <p>
        Seeing like a State by James C. Scott is an exploration of the ways that
        governments have shaped the world to their ends over the past few
        hundred years. The enlightenment created a new faith in
        <em>science</em>, and the use of the scientific method to understand and
        dramatically reshape society and culture. Scott ambitiously groups
        together many separate social phenomena, as disparate as the creation of
        standardized units of measurement, the adoption of permanent surnames,
        the central planning of economies, scientific agriculture, and modern
        city planning, into a coherent process of centralization and
        standardization undertaken by states, calling the philosophy underlying
        all of these developments <em>high modernism.</em>
        <em>High modernism</em> is essentially the belief that “traditional”
        forms of knowledge and ways of doing things are basically backwards and
        outdated, and that the application of central planning by trained
        experts using <em>science</em> ought to replace these traditional forms
        completely. In the case of standardizing measurements, this looks like
        replacing local, colloquial measurements, which are based on the
        industries that use them and vary greatly from region to region, with
        standards like metres, kilograms, etc. In the case of city planning,
        this means replacing ancient, dense, unplanned cities with centrally
        planned grid cities zoned to create order and regularity. The book is
        generally a critique of high modernism, and especially the application
        of this philosophy in authoritarian settings like communist states and
        European colonies.

          For example, the expansion of “modern” agriculture – monocropped,
          huge-scale industrial farms – in the “third world” by Western nations
          in colonial and non-colonial settings. He makes it clear that this was
          often done with ostensibly good intentions, in the name of development
          and modernization. Yet, often these schemes were spectacular failures,
          sometimes with fatal results for the local people on whom these
          schemes were forced. Scott documents how Western scientists and
          governments had little regard for the applied knowledge (he resists
          the term “traditional knowledge”, since it implies a dogmatic and
          ignorant practice) of the local populations, even though it usually
          turned out that their practices had strong effectiveness in the local
          contexts to which they were adapted. An indigenous farmer in South
          America might farm in a polyculture, planting many crops and several
          varieties of the same crop (corn, sweet potatoes, rice, etc.) in one
          plot. These messy looking farms appeared disorderly and inefficient to
          Western people, who tried to get them to plant monocultures in neat,
          orderly rows; but it turns out that this preference for visual order
          was not exactly scientifically based and more of an aesthetic
          preference. An indigenous farmer’s strategy might balance several
          objectives at once, like preventing erosion, resilience against pests
          and disease, and providing complete nutrition for his family, but
          these objectives were unseen by Western rationality, which prized
          total yield above everything else.

        I enjoyed reading about each of the examples of “high modernism”
        explored in this book, and I think the extrapolation is convincing,
        personally. Grand schemes which ignore local context and attempt to make
        complex systems “legible” are dangerous and often blow up in one’s face.
        I think I was already primed to agree with this from reading
        <em>Antifragile</em> by Nassim Taleb, another book that talks
        extensively about complex systems and our failure to control or simplify
        them. That, and my experience with Jane Jacobs (<em
          >Life and Death of Great American Cities</em
        >) and the blog
        <a href="http://strongtowns.org">strongtowns.org</a> meant that the
        chapter on city planning was mostly review for me, though I always like
        having my prior opinions validated!

        this book is a frame shifter, encouraging readers to respect complex,
        emergent phenomena and the order hidden in them. Cities, natural
        ecosystems, and languages are all examples here. A city is more related
        to a forest than it is to say, a car, because cities are emergent (i.e.
        “natural”) whereas as car is engineered, top-down, and complicated but
        not complex. We still make the mistake, I think, of trying to engineer
        complex systems, and wrangle them into predictability and stability. If
        anything, this book implores us to exercise some humility when
        considering a new mega-project to completely reinvent some domain of
        human activity. In the conclusion to the book, Scott proposes a few
        rules of thumb to guide decision making to avoid repeating the mistakes
        of high modernism:
        <em>take small steps, favour reversibility, plan on surprises,</em> and
        <em>plan on human inventiveness.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the entire book, Scott often qualifies his claims, acknowledging
        that there are probably many domains where top-down, hierarchical
        systems work well, where grand schemes work well, where extensive
        planning works well; he points to examples like healthcare planning and
        transportation networks. Scale matters; while a city should not be
        centrally planned, a single apartment probably should be; while a
        country probably shouldn’t spend billions of dollars building huge,
        mechanized farms, spending billions of dollars on a robust high-speed
        rail network is more likely to be a good investment. Once I began to
        think in terms of spontaneous order vs. centralized engineering, I
        started to see examples of it everywhere. I think it even exists at the
        personal level; some people organize themselves according to
        adaptability and incrementalism, and others are more given to long-term
        goal setting and attempting to plan and control their environment.
        Observing the world in terms of this dichotomy might be useful to learn
        when each strategy is appropriate in one’s own life.

      <p>I highly recommend this book.</p>
